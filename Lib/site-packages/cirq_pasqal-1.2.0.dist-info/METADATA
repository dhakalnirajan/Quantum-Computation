`Cirq <https://quantumai.google/cirq>`__ is a Python library for writing, manipulating, and optimizing quantum
circuits and running them against quantum computers and simulators.

This module is **cirq-pasqal**, which provides everything you'll need to run Cirq quantum algorithms on pasqal quantum computers.

Documentation
-------------

To get started with pasqal quantum computing services, checkout the following guide and tutorial:

- `Access and authentication <https://quantumai.google/cirq/pasqal/access>`__
- `Getting started guide <https://quantumai.google/cirq/tutorials/pasqal/getting_started>`__

Installation
------------

To install the stable version of only **cirq-pasqal**, use `pip install cirq-pasqal`.
To install the pre-release version of only **cirq-pasqal**, use `pip install cirq-pasqal --pre`.

Note, that this will install both **cirq-pasqal** and **cirq-core**.

To get all the optional modules installed, you'll have to use `pip install cirq` or `pip install cirq --pre` for the pre-release version.

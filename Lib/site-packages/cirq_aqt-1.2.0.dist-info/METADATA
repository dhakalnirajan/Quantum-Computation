`Cirq <https://quantumai.google/cirq>`__ is a Python library for writing, manipulating, and optimizing quantum
circuits and running them against quantum computers and simulators.

This module is **cirq-aqt**, which provides everything you'll need to run Cirq quantum algorithms on AQT quantum computers.

Documentation
-------------

To get started with the Alpine Quantum Technologies, checkout the following guide and tutorial:

- `Access and authentication <https://quantumai.google/cirq/aqt/access>`__
- `Getting started guide <https://quantumai.google/cirq/tutorials/aqt/getting_started>`__

Installation
------------

To install the stable version of only **cirq-aqt**, use `pip install cirq-aqt`.
To install the pre-release version of only **cirq-aqt**, use `pip install cirq-aqt --pre`.

Note, that this will install both cirq-aqt and cirq-core as well.

To get all the optional modules installed as well, you'll have to use `pip install cirq` or `pip install cirq --pre` for the pre-release version.

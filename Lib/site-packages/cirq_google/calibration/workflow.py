    This variant of prepare method works on two-qubit operations of the circuit. The method extracts
    all the operations and groups them in a way to minimize the number of characterizations
    requested, depending on the connectivity.

    Contrary to prepare_floquet_characterization_for_moments, this method ignores moments structure
    and is less accurate because certain errors caused by cross-talks are ignored.

    The major advantage of this method is that the number of generated characterization requests is
    bounded by four for grid-like devices, where for the
    prepare_floquet_characterization_for_moments the number of characterizations is bounded by
    number of moments in a circuit.

    The circuit can only be composed of single qubit operations, wait operations, measurement
    operations and operations supported by gates_translator.

        circuit: Circuit or circuits to characterize. Only circuits with qubits of type GridQubit

        gates_translator: Function that translates a gate to a supported FSimGate which will undergo
            characterization. Defaults to sqrt_iswap_gates_translator.
        permit_mixed_moments: Whether to allow a mix of two-qubit gates with other irrelevant
